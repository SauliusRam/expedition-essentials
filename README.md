# **Hello adventurer!**
  Are you looking for the **best adventure of your life?** Look no further! With this datapack **you will fulfill your adventure needs at its fullest!**
  
This Minecraft datapack is designed to enhance players' **exploration and survival experiences** by allowing them to **create, manage, and deploy customizable camps!** Whether traveling through the world or settling in new areas, players can use this datapack to set up temporary or permanent camps that cater to their needs.
  
**Multiplayer compatible!**
## **Using this datapack you can**
**Create** 11x10x11 your **own camps** or **use beautiful presets**!

**Pack your camp** (mobile base) and **unpack your camp** wherever you go!

**Modify you camp** however you want!

**Use beautiful presets** using gathered materials to quickly build your camp (and modify, of course)!

## How to create a camp
Craft a camping manual book:

![Camping manual](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/0e5302dd3b5e3390748d391d17663f61440bb241.png)

Stand wherever you want and **read the cmaping manual book**.

Where you stand will be **the middle of the camp**.
A dropper is placed in the middle of the camp aswell. While **dropper is placed in the middle of the camp** particles will **indicate boundries of the camp**.

If you breake it and want to place it again just **hold the dropper in your main hand** and particles will **indicate the middle of the camp**.

## How to pack and unpack camps

### Packing camp
**Read the book again** and camp will pack in **10 seconds**.


### Unpacking camp

Stand wherever you want and **read the camping manual book** angain. Wherever you stand will be **the middle of the camp**. **Stand back and watch you camp set up!**

### Using presets

Place **required materials** in the dropper (while it is placed in the middle of the camp), **stand back and watch the preset being built!**

## Respawn

When a player **creates or unpacks a camp** the player sets respawn point where the camp is created or unpacked for **himself and all the players around** that are within **10 blocks radius**!

Basically the player and his camp buddies respawn at the location where the last time **camp is unpacked or created!**

## Important notes

If you add this datapack **after the world is created** run command /reload for the **datapack to work correctly!**

Its recommended to create and unpack camps on **flat and open areas!**

## Issues

**Please report all bugs and issues** github, it helps a lot!
**Discussions is now open on github aswell!** Share you ideas, creations and suggestions!

## Future plans

My next big goal is to make **customisable camp size** in settings or via upgrades. I'll open a pool on the github!

## Limitations:

However cool this datapack is, it has its drawbacks:
1. **No entities** (armor stands, paintins, mobs etc.) can be packed within the camp.
2. **No falling blocks** (anvils, sand, gravel) can be placed **directly on the camp ground**.
3. In one world can be up to **38 camps.**
